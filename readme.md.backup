# Bug Tracker


## What is Bug Trackr? 

Bug Trackr is a **native Windows program** that allows you to take control of your projects. You can track progress, adding bugs that can appear during the development for his correct control and resolution. Or just assign tasks to members of the team for development.

*******************************************************

## Let's start from the beginning

You can find the installer on the "Installer" folder or click on this link:
[Installer folder](https://github.com/Twentyeight07/Bug-Tracker/blob/master/Installer/BugTrackerSetup.exe)
Just click on "Download" and instal it

In orden to use the program you need to create an account

![LoginPage](./Assets/Tutorial/CreateAnAccount.png)

This is the Login page, is the first thing you're going to see when open Bug Trackr. Click on "Don't have an account?" to create one.

![SignIn](./Assets/Tutorial/SignIn.png)

Now, you need to provide some details to create the account:

+ **Company Name:** This is a program oriented to the group work, so you should put a name to your group (company name field) don't matter if is not a company name, can be whatever you want.
+ **Name:** Your name, just to be identificated.
+ **Last Name:** this is optional.
+ **Email:** This is important because is the way you're going to LogIn into the program (like an user name) and is the only way to  recover your password via email.
+ **Password:** There's no requirements for the password, you can put whatever you want, 123 is possible, but seriously 123?

## How to start? üèÅ

You just created your account, you see the Main Menu but you can't understand how all works.
You don't know how add people to your team, start working and carry out control
of your projects.

![MainMenu](./Assets/Tutorial/MainMenuMark.png)
This is the Main Menu, let's see what is every section:

1. **Edit Profile:** Here you can change details of your profile as your password, email and if you're admin can change the Company name too. But more important: you can add members to your team. And delete members too.
2. **Dashboard:** You can see a fast resumen of the projects you have.
3. **Bugs:** From here you can access to all Bugs reported in all the projects. If you know exactly what bug you want to see (you can filter by title) this is the page you want to enter.
4. **Projects:** And here is the most important page, here you can add or delete projects. You can access to a Project Page to see only bugs reported in that project, etc.
5. **Reports:** You can see charts with the numbers of bugs, state of bugs, severity and bugs assigned to. (* The reports section is only visible to admin accounts.)
6. **LogOut:** LogOut from your account and open another.

************************************************************
## Adding new members to your team ‚ûï
Once you registered your account with the company name, no one can create an account 
with the same company name to get admin access. If you need another admin in your team 
**you have to create manually his account.**

‚ùó**Important:** you cannot change the admin role later, if you want to delete that privilage you need to 
delete that user and create it again.

![AddNewMember](./Assets/Tutorial/AddMember.png)
On the section to edit your profile, at the bottom, you can add new members to your team. And assign or not an admin role

To create a new member you need to enter in your **profile section** and navigate to the bottom. there you're going to find the section to add a new member to your team, enter the name, email (user to login), a temporal password 
and an admin role or not. that's all!

## Deleting a member from your team ‚ùå
This is so easy. You just have to navigate bellow the **"Add member"** section, and there you will find the section to delete a member.
